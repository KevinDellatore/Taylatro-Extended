WIP Balatro overhaul 

Turns game into TAYLATRO! Inspired by the twitch streamer Taylien! 

This mod contains an almost completed retexture of all base game Jokers, and reskins the Ace and Face cards to Dingle! 

It also adds 2 (currently) Jokers inspired by stream events, Pipe and Toilet Seat, including their sounds stright from stream! 

Both jokers contain a 1 in 5 chance to add 5x multiplier to your hand score.

I understand any leineincy you may have and respect if you're unwilling to install because of this. Be aware that this is something of a false positive. 
Lovely ACTS similar to a virus because it injects mod files into the game when it launches. Trojan maleware acts in a similar way to inject your PC with maleware. However, Lovely is recognized as safe on the Balatro Discord server and Subreddit. 
If you wish to install this, but are hesitent any questions reguarding the false positive can be taken to the Modding chat channel on the official Balatro discord server.
