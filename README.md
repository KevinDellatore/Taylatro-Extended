WARNING: Lovely will probably be flagged by your PCs anti-virus software. This is a false-positive triggered by the way the mod works. Rest assured that it is 100% not an actual Virus, as long as you download it from the above Github link, this can be guarenteed. If you wanna know *why* its flagged read below, otherwise skip to the guide below. 

Lovely is flagged because it is a code injector. When the game launches, it reads the files in the mod folder, and injects them into the game at runtime. Many actual harmful viruses work in a similar way by injecting malicious code / files into your computers file system. More info can be read about this on the official Github page for Lovely or the official Discord for Balatro.
